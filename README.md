## Getting Started With Next.js

Step 1 : **Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en)** 

Step 2 : **Create a floder and open terminal within that folder.**
Type 
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest 
```

Step 3 : First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Step 4 : Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Step 5 : You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Step 6 : **Upload code to your Github profile as a repository.**

## Tailwind CSS

This project is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS allows you to quickly build modern and responsive user interfaces by providing low-level utility classes that can be composed to create complex designs.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
